# Job Scrapper Analysis


*Context

Cameroon has a current population of about 24.053.727 inhabitants, out of which about 10.000.000 are of age to be job seekers or job owners, but unfortunately the rate of unemployement out of that number is about 75%, which is a very critical situation for the emancipation of youths in Cameroon and says a lot on the economical status of the country itself.

Nonetheless the development of the internet has made it possible for some of the youth to have access to information related to everything. Thus the possibility to have access to job offers through the internet.

In the process of participating in the reduction  of the unemployement rate of youth in Cameroon by informing on the job opportunities available, many services were born and most of them simply work on the possibility for users to search for jobs by different categories and interests on their respective website platforms.


## Problem with the actual services.

When a user is looking for a job he obviously and logically want or wish to have a higher probability of getting one which implies that if the user wants that to happen he/she will have to go through those steps:

1. Search the web for viable job search services websites.

2. Go through each of the websites and search for jobs with personalised criteria.

3. Go through all the results of each search and try to get the best out of the multitude of results

All these steps look like 3 basic steps but they actually require sub steps and a lot of repetition which is not pretty much elegant and instead combersome and the worst is that each of those steps and their substeps have at least one major inconvenient which are:

1. Searching the web for viable job search services websites implies  being bombarded by an almost unlimited amount of links to go through and choose the good to go pages, plus some false positive results in the way. 

2. Getting to each websites and trying to search them with personalized criteria doesn't always come naturaly to everyone so it might be tricky for some users if it is their first time to walk into that particular service. 

3.  And once the user can figure it out he will have to go through the same issues stated in the step 1 of this list, which is basically filtering a lot of results and catching some false positive links.

### Conclusion

Repetitive work is not an ideal way of doing things and it is a very tedious way of doing things for any users, and it is also very prone to errors.
And the most difficult task in the whole repetition is to have to deal with non expected results of search and also with sometimes garbage search results which are not really concise, thus it is up to the user to figure out the good ones.

We will be solving these issues by building a most practical tool to get at the bottom of the user problem which is to get the viable job offers based on his profile in real time without going through any multitude of repetition all the time; with the Job Scraper Tool.

## Job Scraper

Job Scraper is going to reduce the whole process of getting jobs offer by user profile specifications to almost no pain and no stress, by doing the previous manual and repetitive user tasks, totally automated and real time by mail.

### Technology aspect

The objective of this project is to build a web application that will solve the problem most online jobs seeker encounter, as the ones we cited in the previous points and ensure that it offers them a good user experience which implies logic and efficiency.

This project will need a basic database to store user profiles, and use the informations in that database to search request and filter job offers from most notorious Job search services websites currently available.

This implies the use of databases and scraping technics to be extensively used during the building process.










most available services and mostly follow these steps:
as he/she can and get to manually type in his criteria do a search and go through the results if any and try to pick out the links of interest.
--the main idea which is to get access to jobs,
The first thing to remember here is that there is a multitude of very similar services which will consist of manually going through each of them
