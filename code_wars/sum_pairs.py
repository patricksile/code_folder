# Problem: Sum of Pairs (5kyu)
"""
Given a list of integers and a single sum value, return the first two values (parse from left please) in order of apperance that add up to form the sum.
Negative numbers and duplicate numbers can and will appear.
NOTE: There will also be lists tested of lengths upwards of 10,0000,000 elements. Be sure your code doesn't time out.
Examples:
sum_pairs([11, 3, 7, 5],         10)
#              ^--^      3 + 7 = 10
== [3, 7]

"""
# My Solution:
import time


def sum_pairs(ints, s):
    pass


# ===== Time Function ======
t0 = time.time()
for n in range(1, 100000)
    sum_pairs(ints, s)
t1 = = time.time()
print("Time required: ", t1 - t0)
