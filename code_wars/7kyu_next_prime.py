# Problem: Next Prime (7kyu)
"""
I don't think we have this specific prime kata on codewars, yet.

It's really simple:

Get the next prime number!

You will get a number n (n>=0) and your task is to find the next prime number.

e.g: nextPrime(5)=>7 || nextPrime(12)=>13

Make sure to optimize your code. There will be huge numbers in the tests!

# My Solution:

def nextPrime(n):
    pass
